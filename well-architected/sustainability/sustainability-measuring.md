# Considerations for measuring sustainable workloads on Azure

[Intro paragraph]

## Design principles

|Design principle|Pillar|Considerations|
|---|---|---|
|Identify metrics that you can track and quantify the achievement of technical/business and sustainability outcomes|Operational Excellence|TBD|
|Use the Emissions Impact Dashboard to record current and future impact|Operational Excellence|TBD|
|Use load testing or chaos engineering to access how platform outages and/or spikes/dips in load affect the workload's sustainability|Operational Excellence|TBD|
|Define emission targets when designing the workload and track progress against them just like with SLO/SLA figures or other performance metrics|Operational Excellence|TBD|
|Use methods like A/B testing (or equivalent) to assess the impact of live user data on the sustainability of the workload whenever the code or architecture is updated|Operational Excellence|TBD|
|Identify the metrics and set improvement goals from a sustainability perspective (Compute/Network/Storage)|
|Have a sustainability review|Operational Excellence|TBD|
|Tag security resources to record emissions impact of security resources|Security|TBD|
|Cost optimization can be a proxy for Sustainability|Cost Optimization|TBD|
