# Operational procedure considerations for sustainable workloads on Azure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article is part of the [Azure Well-Architected sustainable workload](index.yml) series. If you aren't familiar with this series, we recommend you start with [what is a sustainable workload?](sustainability-get-started.md#what-is-a-sustainable-workload)

## Measure and track carbon impact

### Design considerations

- An essential aspect of working toward any sustainability goal is tracking and quantifying the progress. If you can't track and measure the impact, you will never be sure if the efforts are worthwhile.

- WIP: Define emission targets.

- WIP: Identify the metrics and set improvement goals.

- WIP: Conduct a sustainability review

- WIP: Cost optimization as a proxy

### Design recommendations

- Use the [Emissions Impact Dashboard](https://www.microsoft.com/sustainability/emissions-impact-dashboard) to record current and future environmental impact.
  - Identify and track metrics to quantify the achievement of technical, business, and sustainability outcomes.
  - Rely on tooling to help measure the impact, and record any changes made to your workload.

- Define emission targets when designing the workload.
  - _Track the progress with [Service Level Objectives](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/monitor/service-level-objectives) (SLO) or [Service Level Agreements](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/business-metrics) (SLA), or other performance metrics._ (Measuring sustainability)

- _WIP: Consider defining policies for minimum emission standards of any additions or changes made to workloads (Climate commitments)_

- _WIP: Identify the metrics and set improvement goals with a sustainability perspective._ (Measuring sustainability)

- _WIP: Conduct a sustainability review_ (Measuring sustainability)

- _WIP: Use cost optimization as a proxy for sustainability._

## Community and knowledge sharing

### Design considerations

- Teams need to be constantly aware of all the new advancements in sustainability, so they leverage these learnings when implementing workloads.

- _WIP: Allow team members to share..._

- _WIP: Create a sustainability community_

- _WIP: Create incentives for improving the environmental sustainability of a workload._

### Design recommendations

- _WIP: Make time for your team to learn about advancements in sustainable operations._ (Climate commitments)

- _WIP: Allow team members to share their workload and company specific best practices for sustainable operations_ (Carbon efficiency)

- _WIP: Create a sustainability community_ (Climate commitments)

- _WIP: Create incentives for improving the environmental sustainability of a workload_ (Climate commitments)

## Next step

Review the design considerations for networking and connectivity.
