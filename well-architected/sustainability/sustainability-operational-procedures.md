# Operational procedure considerations for sustainable workloads on Azure

[Intro paragraph]

## Measure and track sustainability

### Design considerations

### Design recommendations

|Design principle|Pillar|SGF Pillar|Considerations|
|---|---|---|---|
|Consider defining policies for minimum emission standards of any additional/changes that are made to the workload|Operational Excellence|Climate Commitments|TBD.|
|Identify metrics that you can track and quantify the achievement of technical/business and sustainability outcomes|Operational Excellence|Measuring Sustainability|TBD|
|Use the Emissions Impact Dashboard to record current and future impact|Operational Excellence|Measuring Sustainability|TBD|
|Define emission targets when designing the workload and track progress against them just like with SLO/SLA figures or other performance metrics|Operational Excellence|Measuring Sustainability|TBD|
|Identify the metrics and set improvement goals from a sustainability perspective (Compute/Network/Storage)|TBD|Measuring Sustainability|TBD|
|Cost optimization can be a proxy for Sustainability|Cost Optimization|Measuring Sustainability|TBD|
|Have a sustainability review|Operational Excellence|Measuring Sustainability|TBD|

## Community and knowledge sharing

### Design considerations

### Design recommendations

|Design principle|Pillar|SGF Pillar|Considerations|
|---|---|---|---|
|Allow team members to share their workload and company-specific best practices for sustainable operations|Operational Excellence|Carbon Efficiency|TBD|
|Create a sustainability community|Operational Excellence|Climate Commitments|TBD|
|Create incentives for improving the environmental sustainability of a workload that aligns with the incentives you would award for a performance or cost improvement|Operational Excellence|Climate Commitments|TBD|
|Make time for your team to learn about advancements in sustainable operations|Operational Excellence|Climate Commitments|TBD|
