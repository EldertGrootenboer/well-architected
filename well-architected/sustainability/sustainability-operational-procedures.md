# Operational procedure considerations for sustainable workloads on Azure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article is part of the [Azure Well-Architected sustainable workload](index.yml) series. If you aren't familiar with this series, we recommend you start with [what is a sustainable workload?](sustainability-get-started.md#what-is-a-sustainable-workload)

## Measure and track carbon impact

### Design considerations

- An essential aspect of working toward any sustainability goal is tracking and quantifying the progress. If you can't track and measure the impact, you will never be sure if the efforts are worthwhile.

### Design recommendations

- Use the [Emissions Impact Dashboard](https://www.microsoft.com/sustainability/emissions-impact-dashboard) to record current and future environmental impact.
  - Identify and track metrics to quantify the achievement of technical, business, and sustainability outcomes.
  - Rely on tooling to help measure the impact, and record any changes made to your workload.

|Design principle|Pillar|SGF Pillar|Considerations|
|---|---|---|---|
|Consider defining policies for minimum emission standards of any additional/changes that are made to the workload|Operational Excellence|Climate Commitments|TBD.|
|Identify metrics that you can track and quantify the achievement of technical/business and sustainability outcomes|Operational Excellence|Measuring Sustainability|TBD|
|Use the Emissions Impact Dashboard to record current and future impact|Operational Excellence|Measuring Sustainability|TBD|
|Define emission targets when designing the workload and track progress against them just like with SLO/SLA figures or other performance metrics|Operational Excellence|Measuring Sustainability|TBD|
|Identify the metrics and set improvement goals from a sustainability perspective (Compute/Network/Storage)|TBD|Measuring Sustainability|TBD|
|Cost optimization can be a proxy for Sustainability|Cost Optimization|Measuring Sustainability|TBD|
|Have a sustainability review|Operational Excellence|Measuring Sustainability|TBD|

## Community and knowledge sharing

### Design considerations

- Teams need to be constantly aware of all the new advancements in sustainability, so they leverage these learnings when implementing workloads.

### Design recommendations

- Make time for your team to learn about advancements in sustainable operations.

|Design principle|Pillar|SGF Pillar|Considerations|
|---|---|---|---|
|Allow team members to share their workload and company-specific best practices for sustainable operations|Operational Excellence|Carbon Efficiency|TBD|
|Create a sustainability community|Operational Excellence|Climate Commitments|TBD|
|Create incentives for improving the environmental sustainability of a workload that aligns with the incentives you would award for a performance or cost improvement|Operational Excellence|Climate Commitments|TBD|
|Make time for your team to learn about advancements in sustainable operations|Operational Excellence|Climate Commitments|TBD|
