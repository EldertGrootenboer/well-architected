# Deployment and DevOps considerations for sustainable workloads on Azure

[Intro paragraph]

|Design principle|WAF Pillar|GSF Pillar|Considerations|
|---|---|---|---|
|Deploy low-carbon regions and process when carbon intensity is low|Performance Efficiency|Carbon Efficiency|TBD.|
|Leverage repeatable/automated practices to deploy, operate and maintain your solution to maximize environmental efficiency|Operational Excellence|Carbon Efficiency|TBD|
|Unit test during low carbon periods|Performance Efficiency|Carbon Awareness|TBD|
|Use load testing or chaos engineering to access how platform outages and/or spikes/dips in load affect the workload's sustainability|Operational Excellence|Measure Sustainability|TBD|
|Use methods like A/B testing (or equivalent) to assess the impact of live user data on the sustainability of the workload whenever the code or architecture is updated|Operational Excellence|Measure Sustainability|TBD|
|Automate CI/CD to scale worker agents as needed|Performance Efficiency|Hardware Efficiency|TBD|
|Profile workloads to make use of parallelization where possible with GPUs vs CPUs for efficiency gains (for example, inference). Profile workloads to get balance of CPU and memory usage.|Performance Efficiency|Energy Efficiency|TBD|

## First topic

### Design considerations

### Design recommendations

## Next step

Review the considerations for network design.
