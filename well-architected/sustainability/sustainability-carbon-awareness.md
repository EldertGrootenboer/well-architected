# Carbon awareness considerations for sustainable workloads on Azure

[Intro paragraph]

## Design principles

|Design principle|Pillar|Considerations|
|---|---|---|
|Unit test during low carbon periods|Performance Efficiency|TBD|
|[Run batch workloads during low carbon intensity periods (demand shaping)](/azure/architecture/data-guide/big-data/batch-processing)|Performance Efficiency|TBD|
|Apply cloud design patterns when writing or updating your workload's code to allow your workload to take better advantage of platform services that have a lower carbon footprint|Performance Efficiency|TBD|
