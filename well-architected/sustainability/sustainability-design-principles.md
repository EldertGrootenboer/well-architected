# Design principles of a sustainable workload

The sustainability design methodology provides a framework to record, report and reduce the environmental impact of your workloads.

To achieve an increase in carbon efficiency, consider how your workload directly, and indirectly, can reduce carbon emissions through:

-	Using less physical and virtual resources
-	Using less energy
-	Using energy and resources more intelligently
-	Supporting older devices

It is important to effectively record, report, and reduce carbon emissions through actionable insights.

-	Gain transparency into your current carbon impact
-	Estimate savings
-	Take action to accelerate progress

These critical design principles for sustainability resonate and extend the quality pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework&mdash;[Reliability](/azure/architecture/framework/#reliability), [Security](/azure/architecture/framework/security/), [Cost Optimization](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/), [Operational Excellence](/azure/architecture/framework/devops/), and [Performance Efficiency](/azure/architecture/framework/scalability/).
