# Networking considerations for sustainable workloads on Azure

[Intro paragraph]

## Optimize network efficiency

### Design considerations

### Design recommendations

|Design principle|Pillar|SGF Pillar|Considerations|
|---|---|---|---|
|Enable network compression. Reduce network payload|Performance Efficiency|Energy Efficiency|TBD|
|[Consider CDN and/or enable local caching](/azure/architecture/best-practices/cdn)|Performance Efficiency|Energy Efficiency|TBD|
|[Select regions based on where the consumer resides](/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/move-azure-resources-across-regions)|Performance Efficiency|Energy Efficiency|TBD|
|[Use managed video streaming services that use built-in compression](/azure/media-services/latest/encode-concept)|Performance Efficiency|Hardware Efficiency|TBD|

## Next step

Review the considerations for storage design.
