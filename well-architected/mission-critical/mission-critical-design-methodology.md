# Design methodology for mission-critical workloads on Azure

Building a mission-critical application on any cloud platform requires significant technical expertise and engineering investment, particularly since there's significant complexity associated with:

- Understanding the cloud platform,
- Choosing the right services and composition,
- Applying the correct service configuration, 
- Operationalizing utilized services, and
- Constantly aligning with the latest best practices and service roadmaps.

This design methodology strives to provide an easy to follow design path to help navigate this complexity and inform design decisions required to produce an optimal target architecture.

## 1&mdash;Design for business requirements

Not all mission-critical workloads have the same requirements. Expect that the review considerations and design recommendations provided by this design methodology will yield different design decisions and trade-offs for different application scenarios.

### Select a reliability tier

Reliability is a relative concept and for any workload to be appropriately reliable it should reflect the business requirements surrounding it. For example, a mission-critical workload with a 99.999% availability Service Level Objective (SLO) requires a much higher level of reliability than another less critical workload with an SLO of 99.9%. 

This design methodology applies the concept of reliability tiers expressed as availability SLOs to inform required reliability characteristics. The table below captures permitted error budgets associated with common reliability tiers.  

|Reliability Tier (Availability SLO)|Permitted Downtime (Week)|Permitted Downtime (Month)|Permitted Downtime (Year)|
|--|--|--|--|
|99.9%|10 minutes, 4 seconds|43 minutes, 49 seconds|8 hours, 45 minutes, 56 seconds|
|99.95%|5 minutes, 2 seconds|21 minutes, 54 seconds|4 hours, 22 minutes, 58 seconds|
|99.99%|1 minutes|4 minutes 22 seconds|52 minutes, 35 seconds|
|99.999%|6 seconds|26 seconds|5 minutes, 15 seconds|
|99.9999%|<1 second|2 seconds|31 seconds|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Availability SLO is considered by this design methodology to be more than simple uptime, but rather a consistent level of application service relative to a known healthy application state.

As an initial exercise, readers are advised to select a target reliability tier by determining how much downtime is acceptable? The pursuit of a particular reliability tier will ultimately have a significant bearing on the design path and encompassed design decisions, which will result in a different target architecture. 

This image shows how the different reliability tiers and underlying business requirements influence the target architecture for a conceptual reference implementation, particularly concerning the number of regional deployments and utilized global technologies.

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) are further critical aspects when determining required reliability. For instance, if you are striving to achieve an application RTO of less than a minute then back-up based recovery strategies or an active-passive deployment strategy are likely to be insufficient. 

## 2&mdash;Evaluate the design areas using the design principles

At the core of this methodology lies a critical design path comprised of:

- Foundational **[design principles](mission-critical-design-principles.md)**
- Fundamental **[design area](mission-critical-architecture-pattern.md)** with heavily interrelated and dependent design decisions.

The impact of decisions made within each design area will reverberate across other design areas and design decisions. Review the provided considerations and recommendations to better understand the consequences of encompassed decisions, which may produce trade-offs within related design areas. 

For example, to define a target architecture it's critical to determine how best to monitor application health across key components. We highly recommend that you review the health modeling design area, using the outlined recommendations to help drive decisions.

## 3&mdash;Refer to the mission-critical implementations

The Mission-Critical open source project strives to illustrate the design recommendations provided by this methodology, and should be used as a source of reference to inform the art of the possible.

There are two foundational [reference implementations](mission-critical-overview.md#illustrative-examples):

  - [Mission-Critical Online](https://github.com/Azure/Mission-Critical-Online)
  - [Mission-Critical Connected](https://github.com/Azure/Mission-Critical-Connected) 

**Production-grade artifacts**: Every technical artifact is ready for use in production environments with all end-to-end operational aspects considered.

**Rooted in customer truth** - All technical decisions are guided by the real-wold experiences of Azure customers and lessons learned from those engagements.

**Azure roadmap alignment** - The mission-critical reference architectures have their own roadmap that is aligned with Azure product roadmaps.

The reference architecture for the preceding implementations:
- [Baseline architecture of an internet-facing application](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks-mission-critical/mission-critical-intro)
- [Baseline architecture of an internet-facing application with network controls](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks-mission-critical/mission-critical-network-architecture)

## 4&mdash;Deploy a sandbox application environment

In parallel to design activities, it's highly recommended that a sandbox application environment be established using the Mission-Critical reference implementations.

This provides hands-on opportunities to validate design decisions by replicating the target architecture, allowing for design uncertainty to be swiftly assessed. If applied correctly with representative requirement coverage, most problematic issues likely to hinder progress can be uncovered and subsequently addressed.

## Target architecture evolution

Application architectures established using this design methodology must continue to [evolve in alignment with Azure platform roadmaps](/azure/architecture/guide/design-principles/design-for-evolution) to support optimized sustainability.

## Next step

Review the design principles for mission-critical application scenarios.
