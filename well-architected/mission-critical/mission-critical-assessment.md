# Well-Architected assessment for mission-critical workloads

This Assessment (TODO-insert-link) is intended to support operators and devops teams in self-assessing the production readiness of a mission-critical workload. It's an effective tool to support the design, development, deployment, and management of mission-critical workloads on Azure.

The assessment is composed of questions that leverage the [mission-critical design methodology](/azure/architecture/framework/mission-critical/mission-critical-design-principles?branch=main) as a way of checking the foundational design choices of a workload’s architecture and the end-to-end operational approach.

These questions are designed to help benchmark a workload’s maturity and alignment to the recommended approach for operating a mission-critical workload. The outcome of the assessment is the delivery of technical recommendations and documentation that provide guidance on how to implement a highly reliable solution on Azure.

We recommend that the team conducting the assessment is well versed in the architecture of the specific workload and has a strong understanding of cloud principles and patterns. These roles include, but aren't limited to, cloud architect, security engineer, and product manager. 

Working towards building a mission-critical architecture can be a complex process, however, the assessment is organized to help methodically check that workloads remain aligned with the best practices for resiliency, reliability, and availability.
