# Assessment review for mission-critical workloads

The [Assessment](TODO-insert-link) is a review tool for self-assessing the readiness of your mission-critical workload in production. Working towards building a resilient mission critical architecture can be a complex process; however, the assessment is an organized way of ensuring your workload remains aligned with the best practices for resiliency, reliability, and availability.

The assessment is composed of questions that use mission-critical [**design principles**](mission-critical-design-principles.md) as a way of checking the foundational design choices of your architecture. It provides further technical analysis into the [eight design areas](mission-critical-overview.md#what-are-the-key-design-areas) of a workload.

The assessment questions are designed to benchmark a workloadâ€™s maturity and alignment to the recommended  standard of operating a mission-critical workload. The outcome of the assessment is a set of recommendations and documentation that will guide you to deliver your solutions with higher fault tolerance, resilience, and performance certainty.

To ensure maximum effectiveness of the assessment, we recommend that the team conducting the assessment is well versed in the architecture of the specific workload and has a strong understanding of cloud principles. These roles include, but are not limited to, cloud architect, security engineer, and product manager.
