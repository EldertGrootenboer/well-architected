# Assessment review for mission-critical workloads

This Assessment (TODO-insert-link) is intended to support operators in self-assessing their [mission-critical](/azure/architecture/framework/mission-critical/mission-critical-overview) workload’s production readiness. It is an effective tool to design, develop, deploy, and manage mission-critical workloads on Azure. Adoption of this framework addresses foundational considerations focused on the [Well Architected Framework (WAF)](/azure/architecture/framework/mission-critical/mission-critical-overview).

It is composed of questions that leverage the [mission-critical design principles](/azure/architecture/framework/mission-critical/mission-critical-design-principles?branch=main) as a way of checking the foundational design choices of a workload’s architecture. In addition, the assessment provides greater technical depth of analysis through the incorporation of the [8 Key Design Areas](/azure/architecture/framework/mission-critical/mission-critical-overview).

The questions are designed to benchmark a workload’s maturity and alignment to the recommended standard of operating a mission-critical workload. The outcome of the assessment is the delivery of technical recommendations and documentation that provide guidance on how implement a solution with higher fault tolerance, resilience, and performance certainty.

We recommend that the team conducting the assessment is well versed in the architecture of the specific workload and has a strong understanding of cloud principles. These roles include, but are not limited to, cloud architect, security engineer, and product manager. 

Working towards building a mission critical architecture can be a complex process; however, the assessment is organized in a way to methodically check that workloads remain aligned with the best practices for resiliency, reliability, and availability.
