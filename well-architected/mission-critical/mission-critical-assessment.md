# Assessment review for mission-critical workloads

The [Assessment](/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment&id=23513bdb-e8a2-4f0b-8b6b-191ee1f52d34) is a review tool for self-assessing the readiness of your mission-critical workload in production. Working towards building a resilient mission critical architecture can be a complex process. The assessment is organized in a way that you'll be able to methodically check the alignment to the best practices for resiliency, reliability, and availability.

The assessment is composed of questions that use mission-critical [**design principles**](mission-critical-design-principles.md) as a way of checking the foundational design choices of your architecture. It provides further technical analysis into the [eight design areas](mission-critical-overview.md#what-are-the-key-design-areas) of a workload.

The assessment questions are designed to benchmark a workloadâ€™s maturity and alignment to the recommended  standard of operating a mission-critical workload. The outcome of the assessment is a set of recommendations and documentation that will guide you to deliver your solutions with higher fault tolerance, resilience, and performance certainty.

We recommend that the team conducting the assessment is well-versed in the architecture of the workload and has a strong understanding of cloud principles. These roles include, but aren't limited to, cloud architect, security engineer, and product manager.
