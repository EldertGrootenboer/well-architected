# Design for reliability

Reliable applications should maintain a pre-defined percentage of uptime (*availability*). They should also balance between high resiliency, low latency, and cost (*High Availability*). Just as important, applications should be able to recover from failures (*resiliency*).

## Checklist

**How have you designed your applications with reliability in mind?**
***

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Define availability and recovery targets to meet business requirements.
> - Build resiliency and availability into your apps by gathering requirements.
> - Ensure that application and data platforms meet your reliability requirements.
> - Configure connection paths to promote availability.
> - Use Availability Zones where applicable to improve reliability and optimize costs.
> - Ensure that your application architecture is resilient to failures.
> - Know what happens if the requirements of Service Level Agreements are not met.
> - Identify possible failure points in the system to build resiliency.
> - Ensure that applications can operate in the absence of their dependencies.
